%Write a procedure named myBetween (so named to avoid conflict with the
%predefined between procedure) which nondeterministically produces all the values
%within a range, inclusive. myBetween should take three parameters, namely:
%1. The low end of the range
%2. The high end of the range
%3. A value within that range
%Example queries and output involving myBetween is shown below:


%?- myBetween(3, 5, X).
%expected values should be : [3,4,5]
%X = 3 ;
%X = 4 ;
%X = 5.
%

%myBetween(3,3,X)
%X=4
%myBetween: Low,High,ValueInRange

myBetween(Low,High,ValueInRange):-
    Low=<High,
    %not done: what is the value?
    ValueInRange = Low.
myBetween(Low,High,ValueInRange):-
    Low<High,
    NewLow is Low+1,
    myBetween(NewLow ,High,ValueInRange).
